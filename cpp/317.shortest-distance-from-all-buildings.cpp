Question
Formatted question description: https://leetcode.ca/all/317.html

You are given an m x n grid grid of values 0, 1, or 2, where:

each 0 marks an empty land that you can pass by freely,
each 1 marks a building that you cannot pass through, and
each 2 marks an obstacle that you cannot pass through.
You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the shortest total travel distance. You can only move up, down, left, and right.

Return the shortest travel distance for such a house. If it is not possible to build such a house according to the above rules, return -1.

The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.

 

Example 1:



Input: grid = [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2).
The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal.
So return 7.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,0]]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1]]
Output: -1
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
grid[i][j] is either 0, 1, or 2.
There will be at least one building in the grid.
Algorithm
In some cases, the obstacle completely blocks a certain building, then -1 should be returned. So this problem can only be solved by traversing the maze.

Need to use queue to traverse, we perform a BFS traversal of the whole picture for each building position, and establish a distance field of dist each time.

Since our BFS traversal needs to mark the locations that should be visited, and we donâ€™t want to build a two-dimensional matrix of visits, then, what should we do, here is a small trick,

When we first traverse, we always find the position of 0. After the traversal, we assign it to -1.
In this way, in the next round of traversal, we will find the position of -1 and assign them all to -2,
And so on until all buildings are traversed
Then update the values of dist and sum during the traversal process. Note that our dist is a local variable, and it is initialized to grid every time. The real distance field is accumulated in sum. Since the position of the building is 1 in the grid, dist initialization in the middle is also 1, and it needs to be subtracted by 1 when added to the sum.

We use the value in the sum to update the value of the result res, and finally see if we want to return -1 according to the value of result.
