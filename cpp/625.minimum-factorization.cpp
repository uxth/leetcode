Description
Given a positive integer a, find the smallest positive integer b whose multiplication of each digit equals to a.

If there is no answer or the answer is not fit in 32-bit signed integer, then return 0.

Example 1

Input:

48
Output:

68
Example 2

Input:

15
Output:

35
Solution
If a is less than 10, then simply return a. Otherwise, first check the prime factors of a. If there exists a prime factor of a that is greater than 10, then it is impossible to represent a using the multiplication of several one-digit numbers, so return 0.

To find the smallest positive integer b, b must have the shortest length, so consider the maximum possible one-digit factor first. Therefore, loop over i from 9 to 2, and divide a by i until a canâ€™t be divisible by i. Store the factors and append them in the reversing order to form b, and return.
