 * 
 * Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters
 * for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are
 * less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k
 * but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k
 * characters and left the other as original.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
 * Output: "bacdfeg"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Restrictions: 
 * 
 * ⁠The string consists of lower English letters only.
 * ⁠Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]
