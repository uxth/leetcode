 *
 * Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement
 * as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of
 * the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this
 * array:
 * 
 * 
 * The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
 * i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * 
 * The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:
 * 
 * Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).
 * 
 * Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).
 * 
 * The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:
 * 
 * Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).
 * 
 * Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.
