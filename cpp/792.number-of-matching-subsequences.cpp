 * Testcase Example:  '"abcde"\n["a","bb","acd","ace"]'
 *
 * Given string S and a dictionary of words words, find the number of words[i]
 * that is a subsequence of S.
 * 
 * 
 * Example :
 * Input: 
 * S = "abcde"
 * words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S:
 * "a", "acd", "ace".
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * All words in words and S will only consists of lowercase letters.
 * The length of S will be in the range of [1, 50000].
 * The length of words will be in the range of [1, 5000].
 * The length of words[i] will be in the range of [1, 50].
