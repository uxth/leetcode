 *
 * On an NxN chessboard, a knight starts at the r-th row and c-th column and
 * attempts to make exactly K moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so the
 * top-left square is (0, 0), and the bottom-right square is (N-1, N-1).
 * 
 * A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each
 * move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an
 * orthogonal direction.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves
 * uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and
 * moves there.
 * 
 * The knight continues moving until it has made exactly K moves or has moved
 * off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the
 * board after it has stopped moving.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 3, 2, 0, 0
 * Output: 0.0625
 * Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight
 * on the board.
 * From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the
 * knight on the board.
 * The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * N will be between 1 and 25.
 * K will be between 0 and 100.
 * The knight always initially starts on the board.
