 *
 * We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape.
 * These shapes may be rotated.
 * 
 * 
 * XX  <- domino
 * 
 * XX  <- "L" tromino
 * X
 * 
 * 
 * Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? Return your answer
 * modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * (In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are
 * different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the
 * board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a
 * tile.)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: 3
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: 
 * The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates
 * different tiles:
 * XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
 * XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * NÂ  will be in range [1, 1000].
