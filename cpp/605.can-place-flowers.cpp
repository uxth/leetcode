 * Testcase Example:  '[1,0,0,0,1]\n1'
 *
 * Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and
 * some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they
 * would compete for water and both would die.
 * 
 * Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means
 * empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be
 * planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
 * Output: True
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
 * Output: False
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
 * The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
 * n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.
