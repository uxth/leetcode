 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,1,3,2,5]'
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once
 * and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that
 * appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * Follow up:Â Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you
 * implement it using only constant space complexity?
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
 * Output: [3,5]
 * Explanation:  [5, 3] is also a valid answer.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [-1,0]
 * Output: [-1,0]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [0,1]
 * Output: [1,0]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
 * -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 * Each integer in nums will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.
