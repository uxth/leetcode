 * Testcase Example:  '3\n[[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]'
 *
 * You have N gardens, labelled 1 to N.  In each garden, you want to plant one
 * of 4 types of flowers.
 * 
 * paths[i] = [x, y] describes the existence of a bidirectional path from
 * garden x to garden y.
 * 
 * Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving
 * it.
 * 
 * Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two
 * gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.
 * 
 * Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of
 * flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden.  The flower types are denoted 1, 2,
 * 3, or 4.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
 * Output: [1,2,3]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
 * Output: [1,2,1,2]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
 * Output: [1,2,3,4]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= N <= 10000
 * 0 <= paths.size <= 20000
 * No garden has 4 or more paths coming into or leaving it.
 * It is guaranteed an answer exists.
