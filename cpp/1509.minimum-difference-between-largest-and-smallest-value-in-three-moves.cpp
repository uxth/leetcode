 * Testcase Example:  '[5,3,2,4]'
 *
 * Given an array nums, you are allowed to choose one element of nums and
 * change it by anyÂ value in one move.
 * 
 * Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums
 * after perfoming at most 3 moves.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2].
 * The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1,1,0,1,1]. 
 * The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [6,6,0,1,1,4,6]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,5,6,14,15]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 *
