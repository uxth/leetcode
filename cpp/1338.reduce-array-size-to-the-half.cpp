 *
 * Given an array arr.Â  You can choose a set of integers and remove all the
 * occurrences of these integers in the array.
 * 
 * Return the minimum size of the set so that at least half of the integers of
 * the array are removed.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Choosing {3,7} will make the new array [5,5,5,2,2] which has
 * size 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array).
 * Possible sets of size 2 are {3,5},{3,2},{5,2}.
 * Choosing set {2,7} is not possible as it will make the new array
 * [3,3,3,3,5,5,5] which has size greater than half of the size of the old
 * array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The only possible set you can choose is {7}. This will make the
 * new array empty.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [1,9]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [1000,1000,3,7]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
 * arr.length is even.
 * 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
 *
