Description
Given a rows x cols screen and a sentence represented by a list of non-empty words, find how many times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen.

Note:

A word cannot be split into two lines.
The order of words in the sentence must remain unchanged.
Two consecutive words in a line must be separated by a single space.
Total words in the sentence won’t exceed 100.
Length of each word is greater than 0 and won’t exceed 10.
1 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 20,000.
Example 1:

Input:
rows = 2, cols = 8, sentence = ["hello", "world"]

Output: 
1

Explanation:
hello---
world---

The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
Example 2:

Input:
rows = 3, cols = 6, sentence = ["a", "bcd", "e"]

Output: 
2

Explanation:
a-bcd- 
e-a---
bcd-e-

The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
Example 3:

Input:
rows = 4, cols = 5, sentence = ["I", "had", "apple", "pie"]

Output: 
1

Explanation:
I-had
apple
pie-I
had--

The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
Solution
Use dynamic programming. Let the length of sentence be length. Create two arrays dp and next, both of which have length length, where dp[i] represents the number of times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen when starting from the word sentence[i], and next[i] represents the index of the first word in the next line.

For each word in sentence, fill the corresponding values in dp and next. Then for each row, calculate the number of times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen in the row, and the first word in the next row. Finally, return the total number of times the given sentence can be fitted.
