 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,2,1]\n[3,2,1,4,7]'
 *
 * Given two integer arrays A and B, return the maximum length of an subarray
 * that appears in both arrays.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * A: [1,2,3,2,1]
 * B: [3,2,1,4,7]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 
 * The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3, 2, 1].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= len(A), len(B) <= 1000
 * 0 <= A[i], B[i] < 100
