 *
 * There is a room with n lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on
 * the wall. After performing exactly m unknown operations towards buttons, you
 * need to return how many different kinds of status of the n lights could be.
 * 
 * Suppose n lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 ..., n], function of these 4
 * buttons are given below:
 * 
 * 
 * Flip all the lights.
 * Flip lights with even numbers.
 * Flip lights with odd numbers.
 * Flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1, m = 1.
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Status can be: [on], [off]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, m = 1.
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Status can be: [on, off], [off, on], [off, off]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, m = 1.
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Status can be: [off, on, off], [on, off, on], [off, off, off],
 * [off, on, on].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note: n and m both fit in range [0, 1000].
